# LambertModels

Lambert shaders in shadergraph



after the tutorial i was able to find a way to mix shadersgraphs into only one shader using the Enum variable. Now to test it you can apply the material All\_three\_shaders.mat to any material and be able to utilize any of the 3 shaders done today(labert, labert with ambient and specular)
